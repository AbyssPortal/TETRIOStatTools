# TETRIOStatTools

### This is a collection of some statistical tools i have made. It is not very well coded but i uploaded it because why not.

**Full disclosure**: this code is kinda bad. I made it without being public in mind as my first ever node program.
Error handling was not properly done.

### Scripts:
1. RecordsGetter.js - Gets the records data of every TL user, saves regualrly to resultsunfinished.json and to results.json when done
2. AverageBlitzAnd40Lines.js - Uses results.json generated by RecordsGetter.js to display the average 40lines and blitz scores per rank.
### Estimated Runtimes:
1. RecordsGetter.js - 1 second for each TL player, a bit more than a day. can be closed midway and saved.
2. AverageBlitzAnd40Lines.js - a few seconds.

### Recipes:
#### Average 40l and blitz scores:
1. run RecordsGetter.js
2. run AverageBlitzAnd40Lines.js

That's it for now!
