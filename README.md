# TETRIOStatTools

This is a collection of some statistical tools i have made. It is not very well coded but i uploaded it because why not.

Runtimes:
1. RecordsGetter.js - 1 second for each TL player, a bit more than a day. can be closed midway and saved.
2. AverageBlitzAnd40Lines.js - a few seconds.

Recipes:

Average 40l and blitz scores:
1. run RecordsGetter.js
2. run AverageBlitzAnd40Lines.js

That's it for now!
